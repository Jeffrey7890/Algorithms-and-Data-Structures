# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures

This is a book on Data structures and Algorithms using python by Rance D.Necaise.

This book expands upon that use of Python by providing a Python-centric
text for the data structures course.

I aim to finish book and log all my answers to the exercises and projects in this book.
